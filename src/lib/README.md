# lib

Some common libraries that are used in the project.

- log.js

   This configures the logger to listen for a LOG_LEVEL environment variable.

- OpenTelemetry

    No custom libraries here, just the OpenTelemetry [auto-instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/js/). Use environment variables to configure the OpenTelemetry SDK. See the [OpenTelemetry SDK Configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/).
